Task 1: Data Quality Assessment

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories organization, seeks help in analyzing their customer and transactions data to optimize their marketing strategy. The organization provided three datasets: Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, and Transactions data for the past three months. As part of the preliminary data exploration, the task is to assess the data quality, identify issues, and propose strategies to mitigate those issues.

Task 2: Data Insights

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has provided a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes, but without prior transaction history. The marketing team wants to gain customer insights to optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing and focus on high-value customers. Using the existing datasets as a labeled dataset, the task involves recommending which of the 1000 new customers to target for driving the most value for the organization. The recommendation needs to be presented in a PowerPoint presentation, outlining the approach and strategy for Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation.

Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation

After receiving approval for the analysis plan, the next step is to build the model and present the results back to the client. The task involves creating a dashboard with visualizations that highlight key findings and support the ideas presented. The dashboard should address trends in the data, identify the highest customer value segments, propose marketing and growth strategies for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, and suggest external datasets for obtaining further insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase products. The presentation should specify the targeted customer list from the new 1000 customers and broader market segments to reach out to.
